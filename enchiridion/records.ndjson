Swift Tokyo\n\n// Boundaries In Practice\nOne of the talks that I\u2019ve enjoyed watching is Boundaries by Gary Bernhardt (https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries). If you\u2019ve seen a talk about functional programming in Swift, you\u2019ve probably heard it being referenced. When I first watched the talk a few years ago, I understood the theory but wasn\u2019t sure where exactly to apply the concepts. As I\u2019ve been writing more and more Swift, I started to see that the concept of \u201cFunctional Core, Imperative Shell\u201d applies not just to functional programming, but also to good engineering in general. In this talk, we\u2019ll go over a couple of specific examples how these \u201cboundaries\u201d can help us write better, safer, and more future-proof Swift code. You don\u2019t need to watch the Boundaries talk to understand this talk, but if you have time, definitely watch it because it\u2019s a great talk.\n\n// \u5b9f\u8df5\u7684 \u201cBoundaries\u201d \nGary Bernhardt\u3055\u3093\u306eBoundaries\u306e\u8b1b\u6f14 (https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries) \u3001\u3054\u5b58\u77e5\u3067\u3059...", null, null, "2025-06-09 02:11:07", "2025-06-09 02:11:07", "2022-08-25 22:47:17", "2023-08-17 01:14:10"]
